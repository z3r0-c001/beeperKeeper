# Session Summary - October 30, 2025 (Final)

## Overview
This session focused on completing the dashboard improvements, removing problematic alert rules, and implementing Claude Code agent configuration updates.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Panel 204 (Light Status) - Fixed Detection Logic

**Problem**: Light status detection using Lux threshold unreliable due to morning/evening ambiguity.

**Solution**: Time-based schedule detection (7 AM - 7 PM = lights should be on, outside = lights should be off).

**Files Modified**:
- `docker/grafana/dashboards/YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_sensors.json` - Panel 204 queries updated to use time-based logic

**Flux Query Pattern**:
```flux
from(bucket: "sensors")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["topic"] == "beeper/camera/csi/metadata")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "Lux")
  |> map(fn: (r) => {
      hour = uint(v: time(v: r._time))
      hour_of_day = (hour / uint(v: 1000000000) / uint(v: 3600)) % uint(v: 24)
      expected_on = hour_of_day >= uint(v: 7) and hour_of_day < uint(v: 19)
      actual_on = r._value >= 50.0
      status = if expected_on == actual_on then 1.0 else 0.0
      return {r with _value: status, _field: "Light Status"}
  })
```

**Result**: Panel 204 now shows correct light status (1 = correct, 0 = mismatch) with schedule-aware detection.

---

### 2. Panel 307 (Environmental Timeline) - Added Lights Data

**Problem**: Panel 307 showing only temperature, humidity, IAQ, audio - missing light data.

**Solution**: Added TWO light data sources to Panel 307:
1. **Lux level** (refId I) - Raw Lux measurements for brightness visualization
2. **Time-based schedule** (refId J) - Expected vs actual status (1 = correct, 0 = mismatch)

**Files Modified**:
- `docker/grafana/dashboards/YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_sensors.json` - Panel 307 targets array updated

**Query Configuration**:
- **RefId I**: Lux data from camera metadata (raw brightness)
- **RefId J**: Same time-based detection logic as Panel 204 (schedule adherence)

**Result**: Complete environmental timeline now includes light status alongside temperature, humidity, IAQ, and audio.

---

### 3. Panel 603 (Water Level) - Fixed Unit Display

**Problem**: Y-axis showing "LENGTHCM" instead of "cm".

**Root Cause**: Panel 603 configured with `unit: "lengthcm"` (Grafana internal ID), but should use `unit: "cm"` for correct display.

**Files Modified**:
- `docker/grafana/dashboards/YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_sensors.json` - Panel 603 fieldConfig.defaults.unit changed

**Result**: Panel 603 now displays "cm" on Y-axis instead of "LENGTHCM".

---

### 4. Alert Rules - Permanent Removal

**Problem**: Two alert rules causing false positives and unnecessary noise:
1. **Sensor Data Stale** - Firing during normal operations
2. **InfluxDB Write Rate Low** - Intermittent false positives

**Solution**: Permanent deletion from Grafana SQLite database (provisioned alerts cannot be deleted from UI).

**Database Operations Performed**:
```bash
# Stopped Grafana container
sudo docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_grafana

# Backed up database
sudo docker cp YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_grafana:/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db /tmp/grafana.db
sudo cp /tmp/grafana.db /tmp/grafana.db.backup

# Deleted alert rules
sqlite3 /tmp/grafana.db "DELETE FROM alert_rule WHERE uid IN ('sensor_data_stale', 'influxdb_write_rate_low');"
sqlite3 /tmp/grafana.db "DELETE FROM alert_rule_version WHERE rule_uid IN ('sensor_data_stale', 'influxdb_write_rate_low');"
sqlite3 /tmp/grafana.db "DELETE FROM alert_instance WHERE rule_uid IN ('sensor_data_stale', 'influxdb_write_rate_low');"

# Set correct permissions (UID 472 = grafana user)
sudo chown 472:472 /tmp/grafana.db
sudo chmod 640 /tmp/grafana.db

# Copied back and restarted
sudo docker cp /tmp/grafana.db YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_grafana:/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db
sudo docker start YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_grafana
```

**Files Modified**:
- `docker/grafana/provisioning/alerting/rules.yaml` - Removed alert rule definitions for both alerts

**Result**: Alert rules permanently removed from database and provisioning files. 12 active alerts remain.

---

### 5. Water Management Status - Dashboard Row Added

**Problem**: Water level visualization existed (Panel 603) but not organized in dashboard.

**Solution**: Created new dashboard row "Water Management Status" at y=56 with Panel 603.

**Files Modified**:
- `docker/grafana/dashboards/YOUR_CONTAINER_PREFIX_sensors.json` - Added row panel (id: 603) and repositioned Panel 603

**Row Configuration**:
- Title: "Water Management Status"
- Position: y=56, below Light Monitoring Status row
- Collapsed: false
- Contains: Panel 603 (Water Level - ESP32)

**Result**: Water level data now properly organized in dedicated dashboard section.

---

### 6. TODO.md - Hardware Improvement Task

**Problem**: Light detection reliability could be improved with dedicated hardware.

**Solution**: Added task to install photoresistor on Raspberry Pi GPIO for hardware-based light detection.

**Files Modified**:
- `TODO.md` - Added photoresistor installation task under Hardware Improvements section

**Task Details**:
- Install photoresistor on Pi GPIO
- Replace camera Lux metadata with direct light sensor reading
- More reliable than image-based detection
- Priority: Medium (current time-based detection working)

---

### 7. CLAUDE.md - Agent Configuration Update

**Problem**: Claude Code needed explicit mandate to act as embedded systems architect with exhaustive research requirements.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive embedded-systems-architect agent configuration to project CLAUDE.md.

**Files Modified**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Prepended 450+ line agent configuration

**Key Sections Added**:
- **Critical Operating Principles**: Repair over revert, exhaustive research, tool utilization
- **Analysis Methodology**: Current state analysis, root cause investigation, solution development, validation requirements
- **Research and Documentation Standards**: Official sources first, use all available tools, document everything
- **Decision-Making Framework**: Performance first, simplicity over features, fail gracefully
- **Troubleshooting Protocol**: Gather evidence, isolate problem, research thoroughly, fix incrementally, verify completely
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify hardware constraints, check resource conflicts, consider thermal impact

**Result**: Claude Code now has explicit instructions to thoroughly research, diagnose, and repair systems before considering rollbacks.

---

### 8. Global Claude Configuration - Project CLAUDE.md Reading

**Problem**: Global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` didn't include instruction to read project-specific CLAUDE.md files.

**Solution**: Added explicit instruction to always check for and adhere to project CLAUDE.md files.

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/YOUR_DEV_USERNAME/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Added project CLAUDE.md reading instruction

**Instruction Added**:
> "Be sure to check for and adhere to any project-specific CLAUDE.md files in the codebase. Project instructions OVERRIDE global instructions when conflicts arise."

**Result**: Claude Code will now always look for project-specific instructions before proceeding with tasks.

## Performance Impact

**Dashboard Changes**: No performance impact (visualization only)

**Alert Rule Removal**: Reduced alert processing overhead, eliminated false positive noise

**System Metrics** (as of session end):
- Temperature: 60.7Â°C (normal)
- CPU: ~70% under streaming load
- Memory: ~450MB
- Stream latency: <3 seconds (low-latency HLS)
- Active alerts: 12 (down from 14)

4. **Test Panel 307 timeline** - Verify Lux and schedule data rendering correctly over 24h period

---

## Key Learnings

### Time-Based Light Detection
**Insight**: For scheduled systems (lights on timer), time-based detection more reliable than sensor thresholds.

**Pattern**:
```flux
hour = uint(v: time(v: r._time))
hour_of_day = (hour / uint(v: 1000000000) / uint(v: 3600)) % uint(v: 24)
expected_on = hour_of_day >= uint(v: 7) and hour_of_day < uint(v: 19)
actual_on = r._value >= 50.0
status = if expected_on == actual_on then 1.0 else 0.0
```

**Result**: Eliminated false positives from dawn/dusk ambiguity.

### Grafana Provisioned Alert Deletion
**Insight**: Provisioned alerts stored in SQLite database, cannot be deleted from UI.

**Safe Procedure**:
1. Stop container
2. Copy database to host
3. Backup database
4. Delete from alert_rule, alert_rule_version, alert_instance tables
5. Set ownership to UID 472 (grafana user)
6. Set permissions to 640
7. Copy back to container
8. Start container
9. Verify in logs

**Critical**: UID 472 ownership REQUIRED or Grafana won't start.

### Grafana Unit Display
**Insight**: Grafana unit field uses internal IDs (e.g., "lengthcm") but some can use shorthand (e.g., "cm").

**Pattern**: Use common abbreviations (cm, mm, kg, Â°C) for cleaner display. Check Grafana docs for supported units.
